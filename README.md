In 1911, famed cartoonist Winsor McCay debuted one of the first animated cartoons, based on his sophisticated newspaper strip ‚ÄúLittle Nemo in Slumberland,‚Äù itself inspired by Freud‚Äôs recent research on dreams. McCay is largely forgotten today, but he unleashed an art form, and the creative energy of artists from Otto Messmer and Max Fleischer to Walt Disney and Warner Bros.‚Äô Chuck Jones. Their origin stories, rivalries, and sheer genius, as Reid Mitenbuler skillfully relates, were as colorful and subversive as their creations‚Äïfrom Felix the Cat to Bugs Bunny to feature films such as Fantasia

Title: An Absolute Gem of a Book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2021
Review: Loved this book! I was turned on to Wild Minds by a friend who read it and gushed about it being an impressively researched, entertaining breath of fresh air - providing a well-needed reprieve from the onslaught of books and articles focused on the current cultural and political strife and pandemic. And I couldn't agree more.

Wild Minds focuses on the early era of animation and its creators, some of whom were eccentric goof-balls and others who saw a way to cash in on an up-and-coming industry. The book begins during animation's infancy, in the early part of the 20th Century, when animation was intended for a grown-up audience, frequently involving adult themes and displaying risque images (many of which are detailed). It ends in the 1960s, after animation's content had become the much more watered-down source of entertainment for children (in part to appease television advertisers) we are all familiar with now. Along the way, the book highlights the importance of classic characters, including Betty Boop, Felix, and Popeye, to the national psyche; animated features, including Fantasia; the military's interest in animation; the labor disputes that gripped the animation studios along with the rest of the country's industries; the rivalry between Max Fleischer and Walt Disney; the creation of DisneyLand; and the utopian dream of DisneyWorld.

Chock full of a dizzying array of characters (both real and animated) and events, this book will appeal to the serious students of animation. But this is also a must-read for anyone just looking for a good story. Much like the animation that is its focus, the book never loses sight of its paramount goal - to entertain. Highly recommended!

Title: Excellent look at animation's beginnings
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021
Review: Wild Minds is an engagingly written and very enjoyable look at the personalities and rivalries that marked the first several decades of animated film making. It is worth adding to the shelf that already contains the standard works of the likes of Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck. Maltin's Of Mice and Magic relates what happened, but Wild Minds delves deeply into how and why it happened, the accidental magic and insane personalities that ignited the artistic achievements. Superficially, Wild Minds has a Max Fleischer vs. Walt Disney arc, but there is also a lot of good material about the Warner Bros. and MGM studios. Recommended for those with an interest in the topic. Just the chapter on the history of Popeye, spinach and the Quakers is worth the price of the book.

Title: The birth of animation
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2021
Review: I have read a lot about this subject, and I appreciate the effort the writer had in finding anecdotes regarding the Fleischers and Walt Disney. There is a lot about labor issues, including bizarre working conditions and poor decisions, such as the Fleischers moving to Florida, and competition for artists between studios. Overall I have a couple reactions. First, there could have been a lot more pictures in it. It is a visual medium we're talking about here. Second, if I hadn't already had a strong background in the subject, I would not have gained enough knowledge to appreciate the ingenuity of these animators on either the technical or the imaginative side. That was their genius: inventing something new, and then making it tremendously entertaining. If you are as interested in this as I am, I recommend "The Fleischer Story," "Chuck Amuck," and the many books about Disney, including "The Disney Version."

Title: An excellent addition to your animation history library. Buy it.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2021
Review: Filled with history and facts that I hadn‚Äôt encountered before so congratulations to the author for the research. While not a comprehensive history of animation, instead focusing on a few people of note: McCay, Messmer, Max Fleischer, Disney and a few others, the author gives us a great overview of the history of animation from it‚Äôs beginnings to the start of TV animation. While other authors may have more detail about specific personalities and studios (some like Lantz don‚Äôt even get mentioned here), this book is an excellent addition to your library. And it‚Äôs really, really well written.

Review: I do 3D modeling and animation as a hobby so I became interested in the history of cartoons and animation. This is a very good book on the subject. Especially some of the early people such as Walt Disney. There is also lots of info about many other people that were involved in the early days of animated cartoons and movies. If this subject interests you then this is a very good book to read.

Review: The book text is fine, but my copy was not assembled correctly. The pages of the photography insert were cut incorrectly at top and bottom, so some are missing a line or two of text, or part of the picture.

Review: The book is excellent, but I discovered (well after the return window closed) that it was missing 48 pages right in the middle of the book. I have never had that happen with a hard cover book.
